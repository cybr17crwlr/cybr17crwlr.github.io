- name: Automated Robot for Library Enhancement(ARLE)
  descr: This was a project undertaken by a team of 9 members(friends) to add to the already in-action automation of Library of IIT Guwahati. We are currently working on creating a self driving bot to autonomously traverse the library with the teams presently working on interfacing the sensors with ROS and extracting data from it. I was able to extract the point cloud data from a Kinect V2 using <a href="https://github.com/code-iai/iai_kinect2">iai_kinect</a> and is currently working to 3D segment objects out of it. Our final aim to build a robot which can pick and place misplaced books in the library into there correct shelves.

- name: Sub-Domains and Open-Port Scanner
  descr: This project was part of my Internship at Appsecure during the Summers of 2018. In this project first of all I built a module to a combined software for active sub-domain and port scanning for web-servers. Later using Machine Learning techniques and the above mentioned scanner on websites, trained a model to predict the presence of a word in the web-server directory or sub-domain.

- name: Technologies for Soldier Support- Health Monitoring System
  descr: Started this project with 3 of my batchmates to present in Inter-Hostel Competition, later went on to present this project at the 5th Inter-IIT TechMeet representing my campus of IIT Guwahati at a national level. This project was built using MEMS Sensors namely <a href="https://www.invensense.com/products/motion-tracking/9-axis/mpu-9250/">MPU9250</a>, <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/MAX30205.html">Temperature Sensor</a> and <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11574">Heart Rate</a> sensor to predict the physical state of ability and inability of a soldier during any battle. Build with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266</a> it transmitted data of the soliders condition to base station.

- name: Automated Robotic Arm
  descr: Built an arm which can any object in a 3D spherical area and place them at a certain location. It recognized objects using OpenCV to detect objects using thier colour and picked them up.
