- name: Automated Robot for Library Enhancement(ARLE)
  descr: This was a project undertaken by a team of 9 members(friends) to add to the already in-action automation of Library of IIT Guwahati. We are currently working on creating a self driving bot to autonomously traverse the library with the teams presently working on interfacing the sensors with ROS and getting data extracted from it. I was able to extract the point cloud data from a Kinect V2 using <a href="https://github.com/code-iai/iai_kinect2">iai_kinect</a> and is currently working to 3D segment objects out of it. Our final aim to build a robot which can pick and place misplaced books in the library into there correct shelves.
