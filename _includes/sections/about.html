    I am a Robotics and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast pursuing my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering at IIT Guwahati with minor in Computer Science and Engineering.<p>
    Currently working as the secretary of the Robotics Club, my research interest lies in the field of Robotics and applications of A.I. in the same.<p>
    Having worked for past 2 years in the field of robotics I have developed skills in robotics development frameworks like ROS and also have good hands-on experience with sensors ranging from IMU to RGBD Cameras.<p>
    Other than that I have also spent a considerable amount of my free time developing my machine learning skills and want to further apply that in the same to build projects.<p>
    I am adept to code in Python(experience in Keras, Tensorflow, and web-requests modules), Java and C++.<p>
    Team Management and Photography are some of my non-technical skills I am confident of and you will always find me surrounded by friends or clicking pictures of stuffs in weird poses.<p>
    In my me time, I love to play games, read fictional books, lie on bed and listen to music or sketch.<p>
